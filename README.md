# RegToInno

This utility converts a windows registry file (.reg) into a script file for use with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

The Inno Setup file is created in the same directory as the .reg file and has the additional extension .iss, so it will usually be .reg.iss.

The initial version only converts string and dword values.

The initial version (2nd August 2020) has not been seriously tested.
